Things to remember for next FreeBSD 12 Â install.

- To switch to current, as opposed to quarterly packages, create the file /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf with the folowing content:

```shell
FreeBSD: {  url: "pkg+http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest"  }
```

- drm-kmod package from ports gets KMS to work.
